## Closed as "not us to fix" — Phosh launcher splash for flatpak apps

On Librem 5 (Phosh 0.34 / Phoc 0.33, PureOS Crimson), the launcher
splash (app icon + spinner while loading) shows for APT-installed
apps like `org.gnome.clocks` and `org.gnome.Console` but not for
flatpak-installed apps like ours. We verified this is **not**
caused by anything in our `.desktop` file:

Tried on-device, no change:
- `StartupNotify=true` alone
- `StartupNotify=true` + `X-Purism-FormFactor=Workstation;Mobile;`
- `StartupNotify=true` + `X-Purism-FormFactor=...` + `X-Phosh-UsesFeedback=true`

Confirmed the same launcher-splash absence for `org.localsend.localsend_app` (the other flatpak app installed on the test device), ruling out a Meditate-specific bug.

Root cause is Phosh's splash not firing for flatpak-activated apps
on this release — likely an issue with the `xdg_activation_v1`
token propagation through `flatpak run`'s D-Bus activation path,
or simply a feature Phosh hasn't implemented for flatpaks yet.
File upstream with Phosh if we want this fixed.
