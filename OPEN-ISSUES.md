# Open issues (2026-10-09)

One list for everything still open: the Android bugs (formerly ANDROID-BUGS.md) and the refactors left from the audit (formerly REFACTOR-AUDIT.md). Done items are removed; the git history has both old files (`git show 6e81927:ANDROID-BUGS.md`, `git show 6e81927:REFACTOR-AUDIT.md`). Bug numbers stay as they were, because commit messages refer to them.

**Ground rules:**
- Decisions go in core.
- No DB schema or sync wire-format change without a migration, and nothing touches the Android build environment (Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, build.rs, main.rs, gradle, the manifest, rust-build.sh) without asking.
- msgids stay unless the item says otherwise; new ones get all nine translations.
- TDD, then a phone check before the commit.
- Before the next release: run `build-aux/repro-probe.sh`.

## Deferred refactors

Only together with other work in the same area; none has a bug behind it.

- **R12, sync runner into core**: core `run_attempt` with a password closure, `SyncError::is_transient_network()`, a typed error, one blob routine for sounds and guided files (remote paths byte-identical). About -150 in the apps, +100 in core, -90 in the orchestrator. Includes the narrow sync-account error enums that remove four `unreachable!` arms. Do it when sync needs work.

## Considered and rejected

So these aren't proposed again:
- Typed serde structs for every sync event payload: the silent defaults are deliberate compatibility tolerance, and there is wire risk.
- A change-counter-driven view refresh: `LocalChanges` is per connection, so sync pulls never bump it.
- A run token on every drop file: only imports needed one (done).
- Number fields that commit on every keystroke: intermediate values go stale or clamp mid-typing.
- Removing the picker's `transient.<ext>` copies: one per extension, overwritten by the next pick, and the guided play-now selection plays the copy in place, so cleanup needs three separate paths for a few MB.
- R13, small duplicates (`hm_mins_key` into `hm_secs_key`, one `session_payload()`): too little gain for touching the sync payload.
- R7(b), a session record instead of loose session state: about -30 lines for about 54 rewritten test chains.
- R15(c), one `SlidePage` frame for 13 pages: every page reaches into its own Flickable, so each needs rework and a retest, for a repeated frame and no bug.
- R15(d), merging `VerticalSpinBox` and `StepperRow`: about -40 lines in the focus and keyboard code the cursor bugs came from.
- R2b, all database writes off the UI thread: about 175 call sites, and no lock wait noticed in practice.
- Closing the file picker before its copy ends (#37): the read grant on the picked file can end with that screen, so every pick path would need the file opened first; a local copy takes about a second.
- A `guided_file_uuid` CSV column (#7): after a restore the uuid points at no file, and synced devices get their sessions by sync anyway.
- Typed `BellSlot` through Slint: large, with no host safety net.
- Moving the whole sync account Save/Test into core: the keychains are per app.
- Moving the Log edit build into core: low value; reconsider when fixing #5/#6.
- Splitting `ui.rs` per screen or the big core files: cosmetic.
- A `Divider` component, a page stack model, caching JNI classes, moving the CAN_DUCK policy to Rust, a typed `SettingKey` enum, a core pending-Undo queue.
- Left out of the bug audit on purpose: configChanges / activity recreate and the import-labels transaction (both in TODO.md); Back on the Done screen discarding the session (decided behaviour).
